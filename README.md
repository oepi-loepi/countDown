### This app gives you a Count Down function on your Toon.

The app has a Tile and a Setup Screen.

Look in the screenshots folder when you want to see some previews.

#### The Setup Screen :
Click on the Tile to start this screen.
<br>Here you enter a name for the event you want to count down to and the date and time. 
<br>When the count down is reached the screen will show the name of the event in changing colors.
<br>There is also a Test button on the screen showing what will be shown after the count down is reached.
<br>You stop the flashing screen by a simple click on the screen. 

#### The Tile :
Shows a message explaining it needs a setup or 
<br>it will show a count down in days, hours, minutes and seconds in 10 seconds steps.
<br>From 120 seconds downwards it will show a big countdown in seconds.

On the Screen there are also some buttons with preconfigured / calculated days like New Year, Easter etc.
<br>Some of them have a number at the end indicating the month / day.
<br>This is because the date for mothers day is not calculated the same everywhere.
<br>The same goes for fathers day.
<br>Make sure to make the right selection 🙂

You need the Tile to start the configuration screen and you can put the Tile anywhere on your Toon.
<br>So you may always see the running count down or.........
<br>since your Toon can have more pages with Tiles you can also put it on a page you do not see.
<br>The count down will still work but you will not see the count down on the Tile.
<br>May be nice when you want to surprise someone.

You can install this app manually without ToonStore :

 - Open an sftp tool like WinScp/Mozilla on Windows to browse to your Toon.
 - On your Toon go to /qmf/qml/apps and create a folder countDown.
 - In that folder you put at least the qml files.
 - Restart the GUI. ( On your Toon go to > Settings > TSC > Restart GUI )
 - After that you can add a tile named 'Count Down'.
 
Thanks for reading and enjoy.
